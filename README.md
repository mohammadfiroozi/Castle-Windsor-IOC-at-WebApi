# Castle Windsor IOC with Asp.net Web Api Sample Project

This is a sample Project written in ASP.NET Web Api that uses the Windsor Castle IOC Container.
Castle Windsor is a Inversion of Control (IOC) container available for .NET and Silverlight.
# What is IOC?
IoC is a design principle which recommends inversion of different kinds of controls in object oriented design to achieve loose coupling between the application classes. Here, the control means any additional responsibilities a class has other than its main responsibility, such as control over the flow of an application, control over the dependent object creation and binding (Remember SRP-Single Responsibility Principle). If you want to do TDD (Test Driven Development) then you must use IoC principle without which TDD is not possible. Learn about IoC in detail in the next chapter.(rfrnc:tutorialsteacher)
